",We were charged £45 per wall which is ridiculous because some walls literally had 1 mark on which was clearly wear and tear. Plus marks of blue tac were not painted over properly  so the oils seeped through the paint through the year so we got fined for the previous years marks. ,,560,0,Nice place but some neighbours are anal about literally any sound.
